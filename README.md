# Fullscreenizer
> Borderless fullscreen is a wonderful thing.

A little tool for making games run in borderless fullscreen instead of windowed mode.
Apps are displayed with a user-set filter to reduce needless clutter.
Fullscreenizing apps is fully reversible to their initial settings, and multiple monitors are supported.
A hotkey can be used instead of the UI.
Configuration options are saved, and the hotkey can automatically enable upon startup.
